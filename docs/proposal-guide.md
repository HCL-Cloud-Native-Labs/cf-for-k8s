#### *** WIP/stub, going to work on a branch to outline questions and guidelines for contributors who want to propose a feature or set of features ***

The goal of this doc is to **facilitate communication on feature proposals and streamline the process early-on** 

This may include:

- Helping proposal-writers communicate what the cf-for-k8s maintainers need to know
- Helping cf-for-k8s maintainers provide useful support and feedback for proposal writers
- Providing context on the design choices and values that we consider in building/growing cf-for-k8s
- Outlining potential next steps for any active proposal, and the path to merging in changes
