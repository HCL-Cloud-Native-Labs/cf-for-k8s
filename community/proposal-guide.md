#### *** WIP/stub, going to work on a branch to outline questions and guidelines for contributors who want to propose a feature or set of features ***

The goal of this doc is to **facilitate communication on feature proposals and streamline the process early-on** 

This may include:

- Helping proposal-writers communicate what the cf-for-k8s maintainers need to know
- Helping cf-for-k8s maintainers provide useful support and feedback for proposal writers
- Providing context on the design choices and values that we consider in building/growing cf-for-k8s
- Outlining potential next steps for any active proposal, and the path to merging in changes

Proposals tend to be used for larger changes, while PRs tend to be made for smaller features and fixes. However, there is certainly overlap between these 2 use-cases. We can decide how we want to link this to the regular contributor doc

# Draft starts here:

## Hello contributor! It sounds like you want to propose a larger feature, set of features, behavior, or design change to cf-for-k8s

We'd like to set you up for success, early-on in the process. The following guidance gives you context on our needs, and will help you express your 
needs to us. 

### Team context, allocations, how decisions are made and roadmaps are planned
Currently staffed at N engineers full-time / Working group of <composition>
Current priorities are here: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-for-k8s/projects/4

### CF4K8s Project Context -- how we built it & why, style guidelines for changes

TODO

### Should I make a proposal flowchart

If your proposed change is fairly small, easy to merge, and already aligned with the current product, you may not need this guide. Instead, [see the contributor guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Context to include in your proposal
Is this a:
  - feature?
  - set of features?
  - supported use-case?
  - underlying architecture change?
 
Will this be a core change, or can it be done asa plugin/experimental add-on?

What workarounds have you considered, and why don't they meet your needs?

What kind of support do you need from us?
  - Merge a PR
  - Give feedback on proposal and/or proof-of-concept
  - Guidance on implementing a proposed change

What kind of support do you anticipate being needed for this change/feature, going forward? 
 - How will it affect the support burden of this project?

Are you aware of other contributors/users/companies who are interested in this change happening?

### How we'd like to receive your proposal
- Github issue or PR?
- Google doc?
- cf-dev chain?
+
- Verbal meeting?
- Slack convo?
